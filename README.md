Loan Approval Prediction
Tools: Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning

Developed a robust loan approval prediction model using machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict loan approval status. The project involved:

Data Collection and Analysis: Extracted and analyzed data to understand key features influencing loan approval, such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and property area.
Data Preprocessing: Performed cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to ensure data quality and improve model performance.
Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Classifier to build predictive models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Enhanced the model's accuracy and reliability by using grid search and random search techniques to optimize parameters.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving a significant improvement in predictive accuracy.
This project demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques for practical decision-making in the financial domain, focusing on predictive analytics and model optimization.
